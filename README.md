# Oregon Coast Weather

It's a somewhat annoying problem to plan out a long bicycle
trip. One of the most difficult parts of it is finding out
the 10-day weather forecasts for such a large geographic
area (such as the entire Oregon Coast).

I built this tool as an opportunity to learn a bit about
next.js, get a bit of a boost on rust, and monkey around
with some multi-process programming. You can find the result
of this project at https://oregon.possing.tech.

## Scraper

A simple rust application which uses
[reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) to fetch
data from [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) for a set
of cities (provided by a json file sitting on the host).

The scraper calls to the api and writes the results back
out to a json file.

## UI

A next.js app using D3.js. I frankly don't know much about
D3.js and I wasn't willing to learn, so much of the app
was generated by my interrogating chatGPT. I sure did like
the way that next.js was structured, though.

## Infra

There are a couple of simple docker files which prepare the
app to run in a "production environment". The only interesting
thing here is the use of cron in the
[scraper docker file](./scraper/Dockerfile).
